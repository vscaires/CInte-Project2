# CInte_Proj2

## Single Objective Optimization Problem

To run the program, there are some constants that can be changed which are
```python
	POPULATION = 40
    GENERATIONS = 250
    MAX_RUNS = 1
    CXPB = 0.9
    MUTPB = 0.3
```
To run more than one run, you have to change the MAX_RUNS to whatever number of runs you want to run.

When the program is executed, there is this prompt
```bash
    ***********************************************
    *--- Single-Objective Optimization Problem ---*
    *    Choose One :                             *
    *         1 - Car Distances                   *
    *         2 - Car Costs                       *
    *         3 - Plane Distances                 *
    *         4 - Plane Costs                     *
    *                                             *
    *         0 - EXIT                            *
    ***********************************************
```
After this the script waits for an input to choose which dataset to use.
